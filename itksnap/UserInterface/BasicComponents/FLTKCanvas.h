/**
 * \class FLTKCanvas
 * \brief An extension of Fl_Gl_Window with advanced interaction handling.
 * 
 * This is an extension of the Fl_Gl_Window from FLTK that allows
 * the concept of interaction modes to be used.  InteractionModes 
 * are event handlers that are associated with different ways of user
 * interaction with the window.  This is used with toolbars, where different
 * toolbar buttons change the behavior of the interaction.  
 * 
 * Multiple interaction modes can be used simultaneously in a stack.  The top mode
 * in the stack is the first to receive events, and the event is propagated through
 * the stack until it has been handled properly.
