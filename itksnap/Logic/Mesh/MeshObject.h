   * DESCRIPTION:
   * This function generates a mesh which represents a 3D 
   * segmentation. This operation is accomplished by retrieving 
   * the image data from the IRISImageData structure and then 
   * invoking a VTK isosurface extraction algorithm. To create 
   * the surface it performs the following steps (GB, MS, TMR 
   * are optional): 
   *   1.Gaussian Blur on the imported image data 
   *   2.Triangle generation using a contour algorithm 
   *   3.Mesh Smoothing 
   *   4.Triangle Mesh Reduction 
   *   5.Triangle stripping
   *
   * Modified by Konstantin Bobkov and Nathan Moon (April 2002)
   * New modification of this method allows to generate 
   * trianglemesh for the Snake Voxel Data. In this case the
   * Gaussian Blur step on the imported SnakeVoxData is not
   * performed
   * 
   * PRECONDITIONS:
   * - Valid Segmented VoxData or SnakeVoxData
   *
   * POSTCONDITIONS:
   * - A displaylist (points) and a trianglemesh
