/**
 * \class AllPurposeProgressAccumulator
 * \brief This class combines progress reports from different sources into
 * a single progress value.
 *
 * This class works as follows. A VTK or ITK process object can register with
 * this progress accumulator one or more times with different weights. When the
 * process object runs, the progress reported by it is accumulated into a total
 * progress value. The weights you supply do not need to add up to one, they
 * will be normalized automatically
 *
 * Because a source may fire more than one Start-Progress-End sequence per
 * execution, you have to advance multiple runs for one source manually using
 * the method StartNextRun.
