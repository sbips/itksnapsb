  \class SNAPLevelSetFunction
  \brief A level set function that implements the generic level set equation
  decribed in [Ho et al., 2003] and used by the SnAP Application.
 
  This class defines a level set equation that is similar to the Geodesic Active
  Contours implementation (see GeodesicActiveContoursLevelSetFunction).  However, 
  it includes an additional Laplacian smoothing (i.e., diffusion) term and it
  modulates each of the terms by a speed function, which is an integer power of
  the speed function passed in by the user.

  Unlike the SegmentationLevelSetFunction, this class requires that the user pass
  in a speed function \f$ g({\mathbb x}) \f$.  This is done because in the SnAP
  application the computation of the speed function is supervised by the user.
  
  The equation implemented by this function is of the form

  \f[

  \phi_t 
    = A g^a |\nabla \phi| 
    + B g^b \nabla g \cdot \nabla \phi
    + C g^c \kappa \nabla | \phi |
    + D g^d \nabla^2 \phi \ .

  \f

  The right-hand-side consists, in order, of the propagation term, the advection
  term, the curvature term and the Laplacian smoothing term.  Each of these terms
  has a constant weight associated with it.  Each term is scaled by a power of the
  speed function \f$ g({\mathbb x}) \f$.  Often the constants \f$ a, b, c, d \f$
  are equal to 0, in which case there is no modulation of the terms by the speed 
  function.  Modulation helps slow down the snake at edges in the image.

  Before passing an instance of this class to a FiniteDifferenceImageFilter, 
  set the weights and speed exponents for each of the four terms using the
  SetXXXWeight() and SetXXXSpeedExponent() methods. Then  pass in a speed image 
  using SetSpeedImage() and then compute the internal images by 
  calling CalculateInternalImages().
