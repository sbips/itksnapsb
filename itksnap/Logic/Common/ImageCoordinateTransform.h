/**
 * \class ImageCoordinateTransform
 *
 * This transform captures the coordinate renaming and change of sense
 * that occurs between the image coordinates, the anatomical coordinates 
 * and the image coordinates.
 *
 * This transform can be visualized as a coordinate frame attached to any
 * of the eight corners of an image volume.  This transform is a combination
 * of rotations by angles dividible by 90 degrees, multiplucations by -1 or 1
 * and translation by the image size
 *
 * In order to define one of these transforms, we need to pass in a coordinate 
 * mapping vector (example: (-1,3,-2) means x maps to -x, y to z and z to -y),
 * as well as the size of the image volume.
