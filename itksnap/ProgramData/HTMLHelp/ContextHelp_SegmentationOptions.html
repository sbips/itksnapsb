<h1>Segmentation Options</h1>

This panel controls how different segmentation tools behave.

<h3>Active Drawing Label</h3>
This is the label with which you draw when you use the polygon tool, the paintbrush tool and various other segmentation tools in SNAP. You can select from a list of labels, or you can create your own using the label editor (see below).

<h3>Draw Over</h3>
This dropdown gives you more control over drawing. It specifies which voxels may or may not be overridden by the active drawing labels during drawing operations. When it's set to <i>All Labels</i>, your segmentation operations will label all voxels with the active drawing label. When set to <i>Clear Label</i>, segmentation operations will override only those voxels that have not already been assigned another label.
